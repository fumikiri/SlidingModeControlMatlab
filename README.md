# SlidingModeControlMatlab

## Overveiw
This repository is for simulation code of sliding mode control (SMC) in Matlab/Simulink.
Plant model is Inverted pendulum( it's model is linearlized) and sliding mode control is used to make it's dynamics stable.
Sliding mode control is compared to Linear quadratic (LQ) control in this simulation.



## Comment
Sliding mode control is one of the strong robust control method in control theory, but it's theory is sometimes difficult to understand and construct simulation code.
I hope this simulation become someone help.
